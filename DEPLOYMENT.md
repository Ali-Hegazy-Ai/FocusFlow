# Deployment Guide for FocusFlow

## Quick Start
The project is now ready for deployment! All file management issues have been resolved.

## What Was Fixed
1. âœ… **Missing terser dependency** - Added for production builds
2. âœ… **Missing favicon** - Created `/public/favicon.ico`
3. âœ… **Fixed favicon reference** - Updated index.html to point to correct path
4. âœ… **Added SPA routing support** - Created `_redirects` for Netlify
5. âœ… **Added deployment configs** - Created `netlify.toml` and `vercel.json`
6. âœ… **Enhanced build scripts** - Added production and deployment scripts

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Netlify (Recommended)
```bash
npm run deploy:netlify
```
Or drag the `dist` folder to Netlify's deployment area after running:
```bash
npm run build:prod
```

### Option 2: Vercel
```bash
npm run deploy:vercel
```
Or connect your GitHub repo to Vercel - it will auto-deploy.

### Option 3: Manual Upload
1. Run `npm run build:prod`
2. Upload the entire `dist` folder to your hosting provider
3. Ensure your server supports SPA routing (serves index.html for all routes)

## Build Commands
- `npm run build` - Basic production build
- `npm run build:prod` - Clean build (recommended for deployment)
- `npm run preview:dist` - Preview the built app locally
- `npm run clean` - Clean build artifacts

## File Structure After Build
```
dist/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main HTML file
â”œâ”€â”€ favicon.ico         # Site favicon
â”œâ”€â”€ sw.js              # Service worker
â”œâ”€â”€ audio/             # Audio files
â””â”€â”€ assets/            # JS/CSS bundles (optimized)
```

## Deployment Checklist
- âœ… Dependencies installed (`npm install`)
- âœ… Build succeeds (`npm run build`)
- âœ… No console errors in preview (`npm run preview:dist`)
- âœ… Audio files accessible
- âœ… Routing works (SPA support configured)
- âœ… Service worker loads properly

## Troubleshooting
- **Build fails**: Run `npm install` and ensure all dependencies are installed
- **Routing issues**: Ensure your hosting provider supports SPA routing or use the provided config files
- **Missing assets**: Check that all files in `public/` are being copied to `dist/`

Your FocusFlow app is now deployment-ready! ðŸš€
